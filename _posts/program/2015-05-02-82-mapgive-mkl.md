MapGive is a flagship initiative of the State Department's Open Government Plan, a public diplomacy program to support the use of OSM in humanitarian and development response through imagery services, analysis, promotion, event organizing and technical expertise in OSM for the Department's domestic bureaus, diplomatic posts, other U.S. Government agencies, and foreign governments. MapGive has supported the Ebola OSM response in West Africa, helped organize mapping events from National Geographic headquarters to Ramallah, contributed to open education resources and open source software, and worked closely with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for a collaborative mapping component to the Young African Leaders Initiative ConnectCamps. We'll review the trials and triumphs of the last year of MapGive, and give a view into the future.
