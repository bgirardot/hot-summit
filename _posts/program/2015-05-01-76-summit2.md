There is tremendous research interest in OpenStreetMap currently. HOT is an important focus of this interest and there is an opportunity to engage with academic researchers to help ensure that scholarship benefits our community and the people around the world we seek to assist through our work. This session will be a community conversation around the ways in which the HOT community could enable productive and healthy relationships with scholarly research into our work. Topics for discussion could include research ethics, opportunities for documenting HOT's efforts, and the kinds of questions that the HOT community would see benefit from having academic investigation into. This panel will include Heather Leson, Martin Dittus, and several other members of the HOT community.
