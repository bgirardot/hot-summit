John Crowley works at the intersection of systems: informal digital communities and formal humanitarian institutions; civilian agencies and militaries; and for-profit and non-profit entities and creates shared spaces where scientists, field staff, policy makers, and entrepreneurs can solve shared problems. He will discuss the unique role HOT has carved out between the formal and informal, the professional and volunteer humanitarian organisations, and what HOT can do to grow that role going forward. OpenDRI and OpenCities are two early initiatives to bridge that divide, but there are now many more, including Missing Maps, MapGive, and Mapping for Resilience.
