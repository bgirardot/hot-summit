The World Resource Institute and CrowdCover/Moabi are launching the Logging Roads project, using the HOT Tasking Manager and OSM iD to upload thousands of kilometers of logging road data to OSM. Roads have been called 'the seeds of tropical forest destruction'.  Logging roads in particular provide an able metric to measure impending forest loss.  We will address the following questions we've run into: Challenges and opportunities redeploying and customizing the TM and iD, touching on the new APIs for each, how to design tools to supplement iD and TM and how to use OSM as a data management platform at the organization level.
