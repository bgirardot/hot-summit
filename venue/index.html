	<h3>Opening Day - American Red Cross Headquarters - Board of Governors Hall</h3>
	<p>The opening day of the Summit will feature our keynote speakers in the historic <a href="http://osm.org/go/ZZcbKyTXR--?m=" target ="_blank">National Headquarters located at 430 17th Street, Washington, DC 20006</a>. The building, which was designated a National Historical Landmark in 1965, houses art and artifacts by well-know artists acquired by the American Red Cross since its formal inception in 1881. The monumental headquarters of the nation's largest official relief organization is also a memorial to the women of the Civil War. It exemplifies the McMillan Plan of development for buildings facing "the Ellipse." It was built between 1915 and 1917 by the architects A. Breck Trowbridge and Goodhue Livingston. <font style="font-style: italic;">--DC Inventory of Historic Sites, 2009</font></p>
	<h3>Day 2 and Day 3 - American Red Cross DC Chapter House</h3>
	<p>Days 2 & 3 will held in the <a href="http://osm.org/go/ZZcbKU7sA-?m=" target="_blank"> American Red Cross's second headquarters at 2025 E St NW, Washington, DC 20006</a>. Built for the local DC chapter of the Red Cross, this building is a prominent component of the Northwest Rectangle complex of government and institutional buildings and is among the last works of the "City Beautiful" classicism in the nation's capital. It is a major work of noted architects Eggers & Higgins with construction started in 1950 and completed 2 years later. <font style="font-style: italic;">--DC Inventory of Historic Sites, 2009</font></p>
