The GeoQ project has been briefed at the White House, World Bank, Showcased by CNN, cited by Forbes magazine and reported by the Washington Post.  GeoQ places open source geospatial technologies at first responders' fingertips to assist relief organizations during crisis situations, leveraging a crowd-sourced workflow model as well as incorporating traditional and non-traditional map imagery and information. GeoQ allows users to rapidly examine areas affected by a situation, input relevant details and disseminate this information to the field. This approach allows GeoQ to provide an impact assessment across a large geographical area within the first 24 hours of an event, providing information when timing is most critical. This presentation will discuss the development and deployment of the application.
