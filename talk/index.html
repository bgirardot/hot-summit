	<p>
		The first HOT Summit will provide an opportunity for anyone involved in humanitarian mapping projects to present, share and discuss their ideas, experiences, skills and knowledge with the HOT community. The HOT project relies on a worldwide collaboration of volunteers and professionals from many different backgrounds and areas of experience and we want the first HOT Summit to reflect and benefit from that diversity as well.
