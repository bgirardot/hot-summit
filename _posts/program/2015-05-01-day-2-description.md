For this day of talks and sessions we'll move over to the American Red Cross <a href="http://osm.org/go/ZZcbKU7sA-?m=" target="_blank">building</a> at 2025 E St NW, Washington, DC 20006. The format for the day's events will be more in line with a traditional conference. There will be two tracks of talks. We'll also have a third room for open space.
