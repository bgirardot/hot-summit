The Peace Corps is currently conducting a pilot project to engage middle and high school students in the DC and Virginia areas in OpenStreetMap. Social studies students map Peace Corps HOT tasks as they study the role of GIS in international development and connect via video chat with the current Peace Corps Volunteer whose community they are mapping. The pilot is ongoing and this talk will share preliminary results and discuss lessons learned regarding our use of OSM and the HOT task manager in the classroom. We will also present HOT use cases from current Peace Corps Volunteers.
