<p>
The inaugural HOT Summit will bring together people from around the world working to make open geographic data available to improve the welfare of people living in vulnerable and disaster prone areas using OpenStreetMap as a foundation.
</p>
<p>Volunteer mappers, educators, community builders, humanitarians, geographers, and programmers will gather for a 3 day multi-track event to learn, discuss and share ideas about the humanitarian and economic development uses of OpenStreetMap.
</p>

<p>Sponsoring this event is an excellent way to show your organization supports open map data to lessen the impact of crisis around the world. The majority of sponsorship money will be used to provide scholarships to underrepresented groups in the OpenStreetMap community.</p>
