HOT projects and mapping parties around the world are important catalysts for volunteer engagement in humanitarian mapping. However there are technical barriers to entry: mapping is a complex practice, it requires specialist tools and an understanding of specialist concepts. To address this, HOT mapping parties typically provide technical instructions, a safe space where beginners can make early mistakes, and easy access to expert guidance. How well does this work? I will compare the outputs of a range of different humanitarian mapping projects published on the HOT tasking manager, and present early results of a large-scale quantitative study. This entails an analysis of all volunteer contributions to determine the impact of HOT projects on the map. A key aspect is an assessment of their short-term engagement: how long do people stick around? Do newcomers drop out more quickly than expert mappers?
