		The map shows the Washington DC Metro Subway system with grey circles indicating hotels, red drop icons indicating the Summit locations and the lodging icons showing the hotels we have special arrangements with for rates. It should help you find hotels near to the Metro lines in areas that are less expensive than downtown DC.
