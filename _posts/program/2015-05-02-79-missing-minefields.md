Peace agreements may be signed, and hostilities may cease, but landmines and other explosive remnants of war are an enduring legacy of conflict. Between 1999 and 2008 in 119 countries 73,576 casualties due to landmines were reported. Both landmines and other leftover explosives pose a serious and ongoing threat to civilians. These weapons can be found on roads, footpaths, farmersâ€™ fields, forests, deserts, along borders, in and surrounding houses and schools, and in other places where people are carrying out their daily activities. They deny access to food, water, and other basic needs, and inhibit freedom of movement. They prevent the repatriation of refugees and internally displaced people, and hamper the delivery of humanitarian aid.  The general public has a short term memory with regards to hazards, warning signs get taken down and the international community loses interest.  Building a open data set in OSM could be a great asset to the world.  Currently there are no OSM attributes for minefields or explosive hazards however there are proposals for them. This discussion will relate to how we can move forward with a project to identify and map these dangerous areas.
