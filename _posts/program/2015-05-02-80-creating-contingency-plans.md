The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team in partnership with the Australia-Indonesia Facility Disaster Reduction agency has worked for almost 3 years to help six Indonesia Provincial Disaster Agencies and the local community use OpenStreetMap in conjunction with QGIS and InaSAFE to build better contingency plans in case of disaster. They are using OpenStreetMap to map and maintain information about critical infrastructure locations in each area and then combine it with scientific disaster and hazard data models to determine what the effects would be of different types and magnitudes of disaster incidents. This talk will review our progress and achievements in the last 3 years, what we teach to agencies and the community and our plans for the future.
