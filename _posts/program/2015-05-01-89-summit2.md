From December 2005 to January 2010, HOT existed as a series of conversations, blog posts, presentations and emails about the wild idea to connect disaster response to OpenStreetMap (a crazy idea in itself). This talk will dig into the vaults and bring out key moments in the evolution of this wild idea to reality, from the origins in the nascent crisis mapping community during Katrina and the South Asia Tsunami, through building support with forward thinking humanitarians and human thinking technologies, to the first HOT activation in Gaza, the naming of HOT, and the first use of OSM data in a humanitarian map.

The raw outline of <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/History">the history is being compiled in the OpenStreetMap wiki</a>.
