As governments, international organizations, and large NGOs get more closely involved with HOT, how does the culture of OSM transform their work, and how does HOT adapt to the mechanics of bureaucracy. In Washington D.C., a group of organizations have started not just talking about this, but doing things together, linking up technical requirements, communication needs, and event coordination. We want this space to grow to encompass other nodes of OSM institutional support, and breath the spirit of OSM into all aspects of our work. This panel will consist of three lightning talks, followed by a very open audience led discussion on OSM in Institutions.
