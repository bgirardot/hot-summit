OpenStreetMap changesets give us access to a wealth of metadata information that is not specifically geographic but incredibly rich. Metadata is helpful in understanding the changing nature of OSM. One can extract additional information about volunteer activity, areas for priority editing, or areas for future coordination. osm-meta-util and the forthcoming osm-meta-api provide streaming metadata tools to analyze edits to OSM on a minutely basis. This talk will cover how you can use this tool in your application and discuss ideas for future development.
