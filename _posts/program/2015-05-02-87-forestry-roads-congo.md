Sometimes referred to as 'the seeds of tropical forest destruction', logging roads lead to rainforest fragmentation and land clearing. In order to monitor their growth over time the World Resource Institute and Moabi are launching the Logging Roads project, using the HOT Tasking Manager and OSM iD to map thousands of kilometers of logging road to OSM.  In our talk, we will address the following issues: redeploying and customizing the TM and iD, designing tools to supplement the TM and iD and to track progress, and how to use OSM as a data management platform at the organization level.
