HOT serves a unique role in humanitarian operations and international development: we bridge the formal and the informal. We provide an interface between three communities: OpenStreetMap volunteers who work remotely, OpenStreetMap volunteers who work on the ground, and the formal institutions who respond to emergencies and invest in development projects. Over the next 3 years, we should plan to adapt this interface to shifts in humanitarian action and international development which will accompany the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the agreements at the climate talks (COP21 and COP22), the first ever World Humanitarian Summit, and significant changes in the donor ecosystem. What questions will we be asking ourselves? What design challenges do we face as we balance the demands of each community we connect?
