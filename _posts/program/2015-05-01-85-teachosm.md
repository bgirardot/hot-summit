TeachOSM aims to meet the needs of teachers and instructors who not only need to know how to use the OpenStreetMap platform, but also be able to organize and run events, manage student accounts, and in some cases, assign grades. TeachOSM exists to promote the use of OpenStreetMap for teaching the fundamentals of geography. Attendees to this session will learn how TeachOSM works, how to use TeachOSM materials to organize better mapping events and how we're engaging the community through sponsorship of badging and microcredentials.
