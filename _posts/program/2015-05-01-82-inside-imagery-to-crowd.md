Imagery to the Crowd (IttC) is an initiative of the U.S. State Department's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) to provide information to decision-makers and partners in preparation for and response to humanitarian emergencies worldwide and promotes innovative technologies and best practices for humanitarian information management. IttC publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery licensed by the U.S. Government, in a format easily mapped into OpenStreetMap. IttC addresses significant data gaps for humanitarian and development needs. Attendees will learn about our imagery processing workflow, our role in coordinating and providing imagery during crises, improvements we made in the last year and how we see ourselves going forward.
