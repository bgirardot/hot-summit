The continued transmission of Wild Polio Virus and poor coverage of Oral Polio Vaccination during Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) is now a threat to Global Polio Eradication program. Among other factors, performance of vaccination team and failure to locate missing children are considered a major problem in planning and implementation of IPD in eight high risk states of Northern Nigeria. The use of GIS maps and GPS tracking has been identified as a valuable tool to locate settlements, help prepare microplans and to monitor the activity of vaccination teams. During this presentation, participants will see how the use of GIS in Nigeria has helped improve the quality of Polio vaccination campaigns and thus contributed to reducing the number of wild Polio cases from over a hundred cases to 0 cases in just a few years.
