Focused mapping of Nepal started when about a dozen people came together for a first mapping party in summer of 2011. Since then we have given over 100 introductory presentations and nearly 60 mapping parties around the country. Initially, we focused on reaching out to college and university students. Recently, we began to engage different levels of government, international organizations and community groups in the conversation. OSM is much more than a map and map-making; it serves as an information infrastructure for a variety of activities. In addition to sharing our experience of mapping and building a mapping community in Nepal, we will talk about how we are presenting OSM as a cross-cutting infrastructure to a wide range of disciplines.
