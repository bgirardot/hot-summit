With funding from USAID the American Red Cross guided the development of an extension to OpenDataKit called OpenMapKit to make OSM field data collection easy and fit into existing humanitarian workflows. This workshop will go over how to setup OpenMapKit, author surveys and conduct a field enumeration. Participants should bring a laptop and an android phone to participate.
