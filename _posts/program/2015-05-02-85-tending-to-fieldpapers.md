Field Papers allows people to print paper maps or atlases of an area, mark them up with a pen or pencil, upload them to the web, and then use tools like the OpenStreetMap ID Editor to turn those pen marks into geodata. Over the past few years, it has served humanitarian mapping efforts large and small, but over time it got buggy and hard to use. Thanks to a prompt from HOT, Stamen is now rebuilding Field Papers to make it run more sustainably. Come learn about all the improvements we're making and how you can help us make Field Papers the very best on-the-ground mapping tool it can be.
