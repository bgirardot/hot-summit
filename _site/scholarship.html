<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
The inaugural HOT Summit will bring people working together to make open geographic data available to improve the welfare of communities at risk of disasters with OpenStreetMap. Humanitarians, geographers, cartographers and programmers will discuss how OpenStreetMap can be improved and better used for disaster preparedness and response. This event will be the first formal convening of the global HOT Community. To be a true convening of the global HOT community it is important to accommodate as many people as possible who would not otherwise be able to attend due to financial limitations.
</p>
<h3> Who is eligible? </h3>
<p>
Anyone involved or interested in the humanitarian or disaster preparedness use of OpenStreetMap who would not otherwise be able to attend. We are aiming to provide 20 scholarships for the event with 25% of those scholarships going to remote volunteers involved in HOT and the other 75% for those involved in mapping in disaster prone or otherwise vulnerable communities. The number of scholarships available will depend on our ability to fundraise and find sponsorship.
